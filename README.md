Developer portfolio design draft, Section 2 homework

This repository will be used to build a web application designed as a draft for a professional web developer portfolio.  It will utilise CSS techniques learned in Week 2 of the MSU Web Developer bootcamp cohort.

The base design of the portfolio page includes a working navigation bar; sections providing details about the developer, links to their projects (with images); and be scalable to different screen sizes.
